# Reddit-Morse-Code-Bot
A bot that will decode Reddit comments written in Morse code.

# Usage
To use this bot, simply mention its name in reply to whatever you want translated. The bot will post a translation in reply to the original comment.

# Contributing
This is a personal project, so I will not be accepting pull requests.
You are, however, welcome to submit issues or suggestions via the Issues tab.

# License
This code is intended for my own personal use. You may download the code and/or use it for non-profit, educational purposes, provided you do not use it to create your own bot. (I know that's not much in the spirit of open-source, but I want this bot to be unique.)
